**Student:** SANTHOSH REDDY KISTIPATI 
**Course:** CS5720 Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Summer 2025

CS5720_HW1.ipynb`  
  A Google Colab notebook containing:
      Task 1: Tensor creation, reshaping, transposing, and broadcasting.  
    Task 2: Calculating and comparing loss functions, plus a bar chart.  
  Task 3 : Training a small neural network on MNIST with TensorBoard logging.

## How to open and run

1. Go to this page
   Visit:  github link
   
2.Open the notebook in Colab 
Click on `CS5720_HW1.ipynb`.  
In the file preview, click download it and then upload into Colab.

Run every cell
then we can see the outputs of three tasks in the code

Viewing TensorBoard (Task 3)

1. After training completes, find the code cell that starts with:
```python
%load_ext tensorboard
%tensorboard --logdir logs/fit

thats it we can see the outputs or answers for the all questions.
